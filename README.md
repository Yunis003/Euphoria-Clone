I am currently developing a dynamic website using a range of modern web technologies. The project involves the use of db.json for handling data, JavaScript for interactive features, HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the content, and Node Package Manager (NPM) to manage dependencies and automate tasks. This combination allows for creating a responsive and user-friendly interface while ensuring efficient data management and seamless user experiences.
